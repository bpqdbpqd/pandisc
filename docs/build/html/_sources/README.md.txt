Parametrized Asymmetric Neutral hydrogen Disk Integrated Spectral Characterization (PANDISC) model is developed to study 
the integrated H I spectrum. The formulation and features of the model can be found in 
[Peng et al. 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.16455).

The package is composed of two submodules

- **model** containing the function to compute the line model
- **fit** containing the helper function for MCMC fit

Documentation
---------------

The documentation can be found
at [https://pandisc.readthedocs.io/](https://pandisc.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). 
It contains the API of the package, and two jupyter notebooks that introduce the 
numerical implementation of the model and a tutorial to use the package to fit on 
ALFALFA spectral data.
